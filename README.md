# Security Operations Automation Repository (Project codename: Candyland Storm)

This repository contains a collection of automated tools and scripts designed to streamline security operations, incident response, and deployment processes. Our goal is to reduce manual intervention in security workflows while maintaining robust security standards.

This repository is under active development. Features and scripts are being added regularly.
⚠️ **Note**: Always test automation scripts in a controlled environment before deploying to production systems.

## Purpose

- Automate repetitive security tasks and workflows
- Standardize security response procedures
- Provide easy-to-deploy security tools for automation nodes
- Integrate various security tools and platforms
- Reduce response time to security incidents
- Minimize human error in security operations

## Features (on-going dev)

### Current Automation Scripts
- **Wazuh-IRIS Integration**: Automated alert processing and incident creation
- more coming!

### Supported Platforms
- Shuffle Automation Platform
- Wazuh Security Platform
- IRIS Incident Response Platform
- more coming!
